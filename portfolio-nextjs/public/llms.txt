## Professional Summary

I'm a Senior Product Designer with 4+ years specializing in B2B SaaS and enterprise workflows — dashboards, reporting, approvals, and data-heavy tables. I turn complex operational processes into fast, low-error, scalable UX through strong problem framing, structured research, and tight collaboration with engineering.

Experienced in shipping end-to-end product features, building design systems, and improving usability under real constraints — legacy systems, permissions, compliance, and data quality.

Currently working as a Product Designer at Cedar Rose (business intelligence and risk management company based in Cyprus).

- **Product Delivery**: Problem framing, user flows, information architecture, prototyping, handoff specs, QA & iteration.
- **Research & Validation**: UX audits, heuristic reviews, usability testing, and competitive analysis to drive decisions.
