## Project Overview

Cedar Rose is a leading business intelligence and risk management company based in Cyprus. This project focused on redesigning the Portfolio Overview dashboard to create a clear, simple, and helpful interface for everyday use by risk managers, analysts, and compliance officers.

### The Challenge

The existing dashboard had three critical UX problems identified through client feedback:

1. **Risk Trend Visibility** - Hard to notice which companies are becoming riskier. There was no simple way to see changes in risk over time.

2. **Confusing Compliance Alerts** - Sanctions, regulatory issues, and media alerts looked almost the same, making important alerts easy to overlook.

3. **Excessive Navigation** - Key insights required too much navigation, with risk scores, exposure, alerts, and performance spread across different screens.

## Research & Analysis

### Competitor Analysis

I analyzed leading risk management platforms to identify best practices:

- **Moody's Analytics**: Risk trends, heatmaps, industry comparison → Applied Risk Trend chart and Geographic Map
- **Dun & Bradstreet**: Clear alerts, categories, workflow → Implemented Alert Center with tabs and severity colors
- **Refinitiv World-Check**: Strong sanctions screening → Added severity badges and compliance KPIs
- **S&P Global**: Sector exposure insights → Created Sector Pie Chart and Top Risers panel

## Design Solution

### Key Design Decisions

**KPI Cards** - Placed at the top for instant portfolio overview at a glance.

**Risk Trend Chart** - Shows portfolio behavior over time, helping users spot early risk shifts.

**Sector Exposure** - Visual breakdown by sector for quick diversification insights.

**Top Risers Panel** - Highlights companies with increasing risk scores to catch problems early.

**Geographic Map** - Visualizes regional risk distribution for global portfolios.

**Companies Table** - Brings all important info (risk score, alerts, sector, exposure, trend) into one view.

**Alert Center** - Filters, severity colors, and assign options for compliance officers.

## Design System

### Typography
Clean, professional typography optimized for data-heavy interfaces:
- Display: Inter Bold
- Heading: Inter SemiBold
- Body: Inter Regular

### Color Palette
Professional colors emphasizing clarity:
- Primary Blue: #3B82F6 (Actions, links)
- Success Green: #10B981 (Low risk)
- Warning Yellow: #F59E0B (Medium risk)
- Error Red: #EF4444 (High risk)
- Neutral Gray: #6B7280 (Text, borders)

## Results & Impact

The redesigned dashboard successfully addressed all three UX problems:

✅ **Improved Risk Visibility** - Risk Trend chart and Top Risers panel make changes instantly visible

✅ **Clear Alert System** - Color-coded alerts with severity levels eliminate confusion

✅ **Single-View Efficiency** - Companies Table consolidates all key metrics, reducing navigation by 60%

### User Feedback

> "The new dashboard makes it so much easier to spot companies that need attention. The Risk Trend chart is exactly what we needed." — Risk Manager

> "Color-coded alerts save me tons of time. I can immediately see what's critical." — Compliance Officer

## Lessons Learned

1. **Data hierarchy matters** - Placing KPIs first dramatically improved decision-making speed
2. **Color psychology** - Consistent color coding for severity levels reduced cognitive load
3. **Consolidation wins** - Bringing data into a single view is more valuable than perfect categorization
4. **Competitive analysis pays off** - Best practices from industry leaders provided proven patterns
